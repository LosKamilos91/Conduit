# 📄 JPet Store 



The **JPet Store** website is a demo application made for testing purposes. It is an online store related to pet store. Like most online stores, you can browse and search the product catalog, select products to add to the cart, change the cart, and order products in the cart. This project involves the testing of an application cart. Testing includes **GUI testing**, **Functional Testing**, as well as **Permission Testing** and **RTM** documentation. The goal of the project was to detect bugs and make sure the cart worked properly.

### 🔐 2. Permission Testing
Permission testing verified access to cart functionality for the `logged-in` user and `guest`. Details of the permissions can be found in the `permission-testing.xlxs` file.

- **Guest** - Access to view the cart and add/remove products.
- **Logged-in user** - Full access to cart functions.

### 📝 3. Cart Requirements
The requirements for the functionality of the cart were created based on the data found on the site and according to my own needs, which allowed me to properly test the cart. The file `requirements.pdf` contains all the information and was created in confluence.

### 🧪 4. Test Cases
The test cases I created allow you to test the functionality of the shopping cart. The shopping cart has not been fully tested. These are only sample test cases created for your own use and were created in **TestRail**. You can access all test cases by downloading the file [test-cases.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eary8ppkEMDl6P6Ax2NxNQTQAq7uCoqH) and importing it into TestRail, or they are available in the `test.cases.xlxs` file.
- **Created**: 38 Test Cases

### 🧩 5. Run Tests
All 38 tests were run, included checking the user interface (GUI) and functionality. A total of 6 bugs were found and reported during the running of the tests. You can find details of the tests run in the `test-runs.xlxs` file, or you can download the '[gui.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qyX1xqI4NBUiEQqZXBw5b2DOydhj4LRS)' or '[functional.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19orK3XnpscVOWvr2vcDPkdk6w3UWxqlA)' file and import them into TestRail.
